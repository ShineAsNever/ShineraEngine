## An C++ library-like Game Engine
### Unstable and lacks of features right now.

Should be compatible with Windows and Linux

## Future Features
- Audio Manager
- Global Renderer
- Multithreading (I'll try)
- Physics
- 3D (maybe)

## Linux dependencies
### Compiled in Arch Linux (on other distros dependencies may have another names)
``` 
gcc stb glew glfw nlohmann_json catch2
```
